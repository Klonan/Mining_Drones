  Changes:
    - Buffed all units health by about 80%.
    - Disabled base game worms/spitters acid on ground damage effect, as it was severely over-powered.
    - Some units attack in a slightly different way, E.G rocket guys rockets will track the target, SMG guy will hit instantly.
    - Added damage upgrade technologies.
    - Generally balanced the units and damage. They mostly do more damage now.
